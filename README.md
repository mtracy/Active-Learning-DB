# Active-Learning-DB

## Static
This is the version of things that executes in a standalone, non streaming environment. 

Should be plug and play assuming that your `$SPARK_HOME` environment variable is set properly. Just clone it, `cd ./static` and run `./run.sh`

## Streaming
In this version we are streaming from a kafka broker. Currently working on this.
